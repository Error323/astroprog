# Week 1 - Thursday
The goal of this class is to get Linux properly installed on every laptops
and/or check that you can log in on the university computers. For all our
programming we will use [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which
works on Windows, Mac and Linux. Be sure to download the Python 2.7 Installer
(64bit or 32bit depending on your operating system version, ask me during class
if you are not sure what to choose).
