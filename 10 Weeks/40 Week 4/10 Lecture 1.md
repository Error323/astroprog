## Basic program structure and plotting
This week we will look at the basics of program structure. How can you make
a nice modular program and document it. Make sure you read all the available
Python chapters.

The homework assignment for group A will be making plots using Berkeley Earth
data, while the homework for group B will be a bit more advanced.

  to the diretory where you want to work, start IPython Notebook in that 
  directory, and finally open it.
* [bad_module.py](bad_module.py) Example of a non-reusable Python module.
