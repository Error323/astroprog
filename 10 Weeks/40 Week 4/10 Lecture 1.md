## Basic program structure and plotting
This week we will look at the basics of program structure. How can you make
a nice modular program and document it. Make sure you read all the available
Python chapters.

For this week's homework, you will be analyzing the Berkeley data further by
creating plots. Download the following files and implement the functions in the
`*.py` files:
 
 * [data](data.tgz)
 * [weather\_plotter.py](weather_plotter.py)
 * [weather\_parser.py](weather_parser.py)

Make sure that your code *runs* and is compliant with the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standard.
