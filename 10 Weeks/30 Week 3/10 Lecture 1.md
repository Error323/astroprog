This week we will treat the basics of Python. We will talk about what makes a
program a Python program, how to run Python code, what the basic data types are
and how to use them. Furthermore we will treat loops and `if/elif/else`
constructs.

The exercise for this week is about Berkeley Earth data and will teach you
