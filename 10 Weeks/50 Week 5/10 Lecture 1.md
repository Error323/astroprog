## Using Arrays with Numpy
The subject of the fifth week are arrays. Python itself does not include 
arrays you will need Numpy for that. Numpy arrays are used throughout 
scientific software that is written in Python. Please read the 
following documentation available on the web:

* [What is Numpy?](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/whatisnumpy.html)
* [Numpy data types](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.types.html)
* [Array creation](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.creation.html)
* [Array indexing](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.indexing.html)

The homework assignments will be about image manipulation using Numpy and
Scipy.

* [Solar Dynamics Observatory](f_211_193_171_1024.png)
* [workaround.py](workaround.py) (If on the university computers `scipy.ndimage`
  is not present and working this file provides an alternative `imread` function
  using the Python Imaging Library and Numpy.)
