## Python Books and Courses

* For the absolute beginner in need of a lot of training there is
  [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/).
* A good resource for Python 2 is the freely available book 
  [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/).
* [Intermediate Python](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/) is 
  a nice resource for more advanced Python constructs. Read this 
  only after you understand the basics of Python as defined by this
  course, and after you understand object oriented programming in 
  Python.
